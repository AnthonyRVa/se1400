        <h4>What Do Others Have That I Should?</h4>
        <p>What others have a lot of on their front page is images. The very first time you enter their websites your greeted with images of their work.This is something I want to have done with my own page. Another feature other websites have are links to a more in depth disccusion of their work. The links are stored in images you can click on which is somethings I'd like to do for my website.</p>
        <h4>What Doesn't Work On Other Websites?</h4>
        <p>To me, what doesn't work on other websites is when the top bar follows the user as they scroll down. In my case I find it annoying as it tend to get in the way of image and makes the whole screen feel tight.</p>
